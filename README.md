## üì¢ &nbsp; Milestone Check-Ins

Each week I will summarize my milestone activity and progress by writing a stand-up. A stand-up is meant to be a succinct update on how things are going.  
Use the prompts below as a guide on what to write about.  
For each Milestone #2-4, you should use all 4 icons.

‚öôÔ∏è Overview - What I worked on this past week
<br>
üåµ Challenges - What problems did I have & how I'm addressing them
<br>
üèÜ Accomplishments - What is something I "leveled up" on this week
<br>
üîÆ Next Steps - What I plan to prioritize and do next

<br>

### Milestone 1

For this milestone you will have created a wireframe prototype in Figma.

<br>

### Milestone 2

‚öôÔ∏è Overview - This week was for me to plan out accomplishing the things I need to do for my project and complete everything on time. I was to start my repo, version control, create issues, project board, and figuring out what server and/or library to use in my project.
<br>
üåµ Challenges - My challenge right now is routing my pages with the library I chose to use. It shows an example but I have not been able to yet figure it out.
<br>
üèÜ Accomplishments - I was able to figure out what two libraries I wanted to use and started using one of them so far. I decided on using MongoDB just for more experience. I was able to have my header to look how I want it to look for the rest of my pages.
<br>
üîÆ Next Steps - My next steps is to have all my pages routed and styling finished so I can start on setting up my server and API.

<br>

Please discuss the following:

#### Page #1

- Hompage
- This page will be directing the user to the other pages for learning what kinds of brands and products are available. This page tells of what all brands that are on the website for the user to know what to be looking for and what to do on the site.

#### Page #2

- Brands
- The user will get valuable information about the different brands that are available on the website. There will be a filter form for the user to easily access a specific brand they are looking for.

#### Page #3

- Discover
- This page will have all the products listed and show what their price is and a redirect them to the site to buy that product. This page will have a filter form as well to help specify which product they are looking for.

#### Page #4

- Promo/Offers
- This is where the user can find all the promotions or offers that these brands have to offer as well as an additional discount.

<br>

### Milestone 3

‚öôÔ∏è Overview - Overall this past week I had to catch up on somethings from last week and I was able to accomplish that. This week was to connect all technologies by integrating my api and mongoDB. I also had to add in content for my website to look presentable and for it to make sense on what the purpose is for the application.
<br>
üåµ Challenges - The challenge was trying to catch up from last week as well as trying to get what I need to accomplish for this week. I still trying to figure out how I am going to integrate my API to integrate my MongoDB.
<br>
üèÜ Accomplishments - I have been able to successfully complete my styling as far as adding all neccessary components needs to work. I have my MongoDB server up and running and I have all files that need to be hidden are hidden.
<br>
üîÆ Next Steps - My next steps are to accomplish integrating my API and MongoDB to that app. Then finish off my styling by add responsive so that it is a fully functional working website.

<br>

#### API

- API Link: https://makeup-api.herokuapp.com/
- I chose this because I felt it would be a little bit of a challenge for my skills but simple enough where it would not take me too long to create for this month.
- I will be using this code on the discover page and favorite button located in the header.

#### 1st Library

- https://v2.chakra-ui.com/
- https://fullsailedu-my.sharepoint.com/personal/ckjones1_student_fullsail_edu/_layouts/15/stream.aspx?id=%2Fpersonal%2Fckjones1%5Fstudent%5Ffullsail%5Fedu%2FDocuments%2FScreen%20Recording%202024%2D04%2D22%20at%208%2E12%2E47%20PM%201%2Emov&ga=1&referrer=StreamWebApp%2EWeb&referrerScenario=AddressBarCopied%2Eview
- I chose this library because it holds some of the components that I want to use for my project.
- This will be used through out my app like the discover page, home page, navigation, and promo page.

#### 2nd Library

- https://www.framer.com/motion/
- I chose this library because I always wanted to use some kind of animation in my apps to make it a little more interesting. Plus I always heard this was very popular for its animations.
- I will be using this in the brand page with the cards. It will also be used in the discover page with the cards and buttons.

#### Persistent Data

- I will be using MongoDB for my app
- This is to store any favorites that the customers want to go back to for later or to remove
- There is a favorite button at the header/navigation where you will get to click to see all the favorites stored

<br>

### Milestone 4

‚öôÔ∏è Overview - I have a full functional app up and running front and back end. I was able to get my API to appear for the user to be able to find products and add as their favorites. I was able to storage for my data. I used the MERN stack to have all my components come together the way I wanted it to.
<br>
üåµ Challenges - It was definitely a challenge getting my API and db running the way that I wanted. I had to watch multiple videos and get outside help as well. Trying to make sure all functions are written correctly and running properly was the hardest.
<br>
üèÜ Accomplishments - I am proud to say I have a fully running app with the use of 2 libraries, API with json, Mongodb, and styling to keep the theme constant. I was able to have my api to appear for the user to look and be able to navigate to different brands of products they would like to use. Then being able to have my db
<br>
üîÆ Next Steps - In the future I will come back and work on the responsiveness and tweek around on how the user can navigate through the products. I would probably add a dropbox instead.

<br>

Please discuss the following:

#### Changes

- I added in the API into my Discover page and listed the types of brands that the user can find while searching for products.

#### Styling

- I went over the style guide that I had set for how I wanted to style my button, what fonts to use and their size for each heading or tag that contains content. I used the library styling to help style the content and I also used css file to help it easier to see the code.

# Project Overview

### Your project will use the MERN Tech Stack and must include the following:

- A Git Repo, with a master, dev, and milestone branches
- Readme File that explains your project and tracks your milestones
- A React Front End
- React Routing with _at least_ 4 different views/pages
  - Dashboard/Main
  - User/Settings
  - Search
  - Detail Page
- Node/Express Backend
- A Mongo DB Element OR Local Storage for persistent data
- Connect to at least 1 free API
- The project must use at least 2 different libraries, not including React itself
  - One of these libraries you will create a tutorial for in Exercise 01
- It should look visually appealing and must be easy for the end-user to use and understand. You may use Tailwind or any other front-end library/framework.

**Milestone #1 (Due: Monday of Week 2)**

- Decide on your topic and theme for your project.
  - Check out the Free API sites for some ideas of an API that you can utilize
    - [Apipheny](https://apipheny.io/free-api/)
    - [Mixed Analytics](https://mixedanalytics.com/blog/list-actually-free-open-no-auth-needed-apis/)
    - [I Am Sajan](https://iamsajan.com/free-api-without-an-api-key/)
- Functional Spec that explains the scope of the work and the deadlines that must be met.
- Create a Wireframe Prototype in Figma that will help non-tech people understand your idea.
  - Keep in mind that a lot of your bosses will need only high-level concepts and will not be concerned with the actual code. The code is your job.

**Milestone #2 **(Due: Monday of Week 3)\*\*\*\*

- Create your Git Repo using the provided link, which will clone over a blank repo.
- Start to code your project.
  - I will not give you a step-by-step guide for this.
  - At this point, you must use your skills and build it out yourself.
- Along the way, if you get stuck, you may reach out to the lab assistants, but remember this is YOUR portfolio project, and troubleshooting your own code is a part of this process.
- By Milestone #2, I am going to be checking that you have a React app that can compile without error and that you have your navigation up and running.

**Milestone #3 **(Due: Monday of Week 4)\*\*\*\*

- By this point, you should have a functional prototype of your project. It might not look pretty yet, but that is what the final week is for.
- Your Git Repo should have a number of significant commits pushed to it.

**Milestone #4 **(Due: Sunday of Week 4)\*\*\*\*

- Your completed project will be due.
- You must create a (3 to 10) minute long video that goes through your project, what you did this month, and the technologies that you used to get it working.
  - Remember it is your job to sell your work and really show it off.
