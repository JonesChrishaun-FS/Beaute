#### Page #1

- This page will be directing the user to the other pages for learning what kinds of brands and products are available. This page tells of what all brands that are on the website for the user to know what to be looking for and what to do on the site.

#### Page #2

- Brands
- The user will get valuable information about the different brands that are available on the website. There will be a filter form for the user to easily access a specific brand they are looking for.

- This page will have all the products listed and show what their price is and a redirect them to the site to buy that product. This page will have a filter form as well to help specify which product they are looking for.

#### API

- API Link: https://makeup-api.herokuapp.com/
- I chose this because I felt it would be a little bit of a challenge for my skills but simple enough where it would not take me too long to create for this month.
- I will be using this code on the discover page and favorite button located in the header.

#### 1st Library

- https://v2.chakra-ui.com/
- https://fullsailedu-my.sharepoint.com/personal/ckjones1_student_fullsail_edu/_layouts/15/stream.aspx?id=%2Fpersonal%2Fckjones1%5Fstudent%5Ffullsail%5Fedu%2FDocuments%2FScreen%20Recording%202024%2D04%2D22%20at%208%2E12%2E47%20PM%201%2Emov&ga=1&referrer=StreamWebApp%2EWeb&referrerScenario=AddressBarCopied%2Eview
- I chose this library because it holds some of the components that I want to use for my project.
- This will be used through out my app like the discover page, home page, navigation, and promo page.

#### 2nd Library

- https://www.framer.com/motion/
- I chose this library because I always wanted to use some kind of animation in my apps to make it a little more interesting. Plus I always heard this was very popular for its animations.
- I will be using this in the brand page with the cards. It will also be used in the discover page with the cards and buttons.

#### Persistent Data

- I will be using MongoDB for my app
- This is to store any favorites that the customers want to go back to for later or to remove
- There is a favorite button at the header/navigation where you will get to click to see all the favorites stored

<br>

#### Changes

- I added in the API into my Discover page and listed the types of brands that the user can find while searching for products.

#### Styling

- I went over the style guide that I had set for how I wanted to style my button, what fonts to use and their size for each heading or tag that contains content. I used the library styling to help style the content and I also used css file to help it easier to see the code.
